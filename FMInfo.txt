Briefing:

"I've recently been contacted by a local business man who is having some trouble with one of his competitors. From what he's told me it seems like he wants me to find out information about his business to get a competitive edge. I've agreed to take the job and the client has told me he'll leave detailed instructions by his house on the night.

It's getting dark, looks like it's time to leave."
