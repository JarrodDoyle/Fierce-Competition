My bitter business rival, Lord Thorack, has recently found a new supplier with lower costs than my own and has been undercutting my pricing. Tonight your task is to find out who it is, along with any other business related information you can find.

Thorack is also an amateur astronomer and I've heard he is planning to present some findings at a conference soon. If you can find and remove his research so that he has nothing to present it would be a big blow to his reputation. I know from previous visits that his observatory is in the south wing.",

I will be expecting to see you again in a few days. You will get your payment then providing you were successful."
