I recently finished the appraisal of the doll you asked me about. I understand that it is a family heirloom so I'm sure you are expecting it to be worth a lot. Lucky for you, you are correct. Your family heirloom is in fact a rare pagan artifact. Artifacts like these are very popular with collectors and are guaranteed to sell well.

I can offer you 1500g now to take it off your hands so that you don't have to worry about managing the sale yourself. Let me know if you are still interested in pursuing this."
