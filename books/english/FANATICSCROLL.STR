page_0: "Captain Rodders,
While reorganising my personal collections recently, it came to my attention that my prized family heirloom was no longer in my posession.

As you know, my wife and daughter recently left me. I believe that they took my family heirloom with them when they did so.

This is a clear crime and I would hope that you take this very seriously. I expect to hear back from you shortly letting me know what action you plan to take to retrieve my belongings.

Regards,
Lord F."
